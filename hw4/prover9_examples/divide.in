% not as tivial as it looks -- statements that cannot be proven may result in infinite nesting, to avoid this it is necessary to employ control parameters such as max_seconds

% why? the cause is the third formula, the transitive clause always allows for a new resolvent, always there are both positive and negative literals that can be matched (unified)
